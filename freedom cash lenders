In their research, Shafir and Mullainathan found that scarcity can create a cycle of poor decision-making. Those who are unable to see outside of the “freedom cash lenders” often knee-jerk react to immediate situations.
For example, they’re susceptible to high-interest payday loans, which in the short-term can ease their at-hand problem (paying a bill) but in the long-term are costly and often fall short of being fully repaid on time (payday loans can charge as much as 400 percent in interest and almost 70 percent of payday loan borrowers take out a second loan).
