A recent freedomcashlenders survey reveals that low-income Americans were least likely of the various income brackets to report their working on their finances this year. In fact, almost one in five respondents (18 percent) who make under $30,000 per year reported having no financial goals in 2019. That compared with 10 percent of respondents who make $75,000 or more having no goals; 7 percent of those make $50,000-$74,999; and 8 percent of those in $30,000 to $49,999 bracket.

McVay was, and still is, one of the almost 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. Today, she’s 33 years old and makes $10.25 an hour as a loan officer and underwriter in Roxana, Illinois.

Her situation has recently improved, but McVay recalls a time in her life where she wasn’t focusing on the future; she was just doing everything she could to give her son what he needed, and to keep a roof over their heads.
